# Osiris Game Prototype

### Game Description
Osiris, the Egyptian god of the dead, resurrection, and afterlife, notices that some pyramids have been broken into and plundered by thieves. Angered, he resurrects you – Tutankhamun – to act out his revenge. However, Osiris is not easily pleased. He expects you to chase and destroy the thieves that are fleeing the pyramid as well as retrieve the stolen artifacts.

### Prototype Description
The game currently is a vertical slice that focuses on item generation/interaction as well as enemy spawning and attacking. There is no player death, and the momentum system for the player is implemented at a rudimentary level (player does not increase or decay in momentum, there are no boon spawners to increase momentum, enemy projectiles don't decrease momentum, etc.)

The prototype has two levels with different enemy configurations. Once the 2nd level is complete, the game will loop the 2nd level indefinitely.

Note that the art is placeholder art which will be replaced with an Egyptian-themed art style when more work can be done. All art has been taken from the Unity asset store.
